===========================

Ex1)

○ create a func with the identifier foo that returns an int
○ create a func with the identifier bar that returns an int and a string
○ call both funcs
○ print out their results


===========================

Ex2)

● create a func with the identifier foo that 
	○ takes in a variadic parameter of type int
	○ pass in a value of type []int into your func (unfurl the []int)
	○ returns the sum of all values of type int passed in
● create a func with the identifier bar that 
	○ takes in a parameter of type []int
	○ returns the sum of all values of type int passed in


===========================

Ex3)

Use the “defer” keyword to show that a deferred func runs after the func containing it exits.


===========================

Ex4)

● Create a user defined struct with 
	○ the identifier “person”
	○ the fields:
		■ first
		■ last
		■ age
● attach a method to type person with
	○ the identifier “speak”
	○ the method should have the person say their name and age
● create a value of type person
● call the method from the value of type person


===========================

Ex5)

● create a type SQUARE
● create a type CIRCLE
● attach a method to each that calculates AREA and returns it
	○ circle area= π r 2
	○ square area = L * W
● create a type SHAPE that defines an interface as anything that has the AREA method
● create a func INFO which takes type shape and then prints the area
● create a value of type square
● create a value of type circle
● use func info to print the area of square
● use func info to print the area of circle



===========================

Ex6)

Build and use an anonymous func 

===========================

Ex7)
Assign a func to a variable, then call that func

===========================

Ex8)

● Create a func which returns a func
● assign the returned func to a variable
● call the returned func


===========================

Ex9)

A “callback” is when we pass a func into a func as an argument. For this exercise, 
● pass a func into a func as an argument 

===========================

Ex10)

Closure is when we have “enclosed” the scope of a variable in some code block. For this hands-on exercise, create a func which “encloses” the scope of a variable:
