===========================

Ex1)

Starting with this code, marshal the []user to JSON. There is a little bit of a curve ball in this hands-on exercise - remember to ask yourself what you need to do to EXPORT a value from a package.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type user struct {
	First string
	Age   int
}

func main() {
	u1 := user{
		First: "James",
		Age:   32,
	}

	u2 := user{
		First: "Moneypenny",
		Age:   27,
	}

	u3 := user{
		First: "M",
		Age:   54,
	}

	users := []user{u1, u2, u3}

	fmt.Println(users)

	// your code goes here
}
```
===========================

Ex2)

Starting with this code, unmarshal the JSON into a Go data structure

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	s := `[{"First":"James","Last":"Bond","Age":32,"Sayings":["Shaken, not stirred","Youth is no guarantee of innovation","In his majesty's royal service"]},{"First":"Miss","Last":"Moneypenny","Age":27,"Sayings":["James, it is soo good to see you","Would you like me to take care of that for you, James?","I would really prefer to be a secret agent myself."]},{"First":"M","Last":"Hmmmm","Age":54,"Sayings":["Oh, James. You didn't.","Dear God, what has James done now?","Can someone please tell me where James Bond is?"]}]`
	fmt.Println(s)

}
```


===========================

Ex3)

Starting with this code, encode to JSON the []user sending the results to Stdout. Hint: you will need to use json.NewEncoder(os.Stdout).encode(v interface{})

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type user struct {
	First   string
	Last    string
	Age     int
	Sayings []string
}

func main() {
	u1 := user{
		First: "James",
		Last:  "Bond",
		Age:   32,
		Sayings: []string{
			"Shaken, not stirred",
			"Youth is no guarantee of innovation",
			"In his majesty's royal service",
		},
	}

	u2 := user{
		First: "Miss",
		Last:  "Moneypenny",
		Age:   27,
		Sayings: []string{
			"James, it is soo good to see you",
			"Would you like me to take care of that for you, James?",
			"I would really prefer to be a secret agent myself.",
		},
	}

	u3 := user{
		First: "M",
		Last:  "Hmmmm",
		Age:   54,
		Sayings: []string{
			"Oh, James. You didn't.",
			"Dear God, what has James done now?",
			"Can someone please tell me where James Bond is?",
		},
	}

	users := []user{u1, u2, u3}

	fmt.Println(users)

	// your code goes here

}

```

===========================

Ex4)

Starting with this code, sort the []int and []string for each person.

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	xi := []int{5, 8, 2, 43, 17, 987, 14, 12, 21, 1, 4, 2, 3, 93, 13}
	xs := []string{"random", "rainbow", "delights", "in", "torpedo", "summers", "under", "gallantry", "fragmented", "moons", "across", "magenta"}

	fmt.Println(xi)
	// sort xi
	fmt.Println(xi)

	fmt.Println(xs)
	// sort xs
	fmt.Println(xs)
}

```


===========================

Ex5)

Starting with this code, sort the []user by 
	● age
	● last
Also sort each []string “Sayings” for each user
	● print everything in a way that is pleasant

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type user struct {
	First   string
	Last    string
	Age     int
	Sayings []string
}

func main() {
	u1 := user{
		First: "James",
		Last:  "Bond",
		Age:   32,
		Sayings: []string{
			"Shaken, not stirred",
			"Youth is no guarantee of innovation",
			"In his majesty's royal service",
		},
	}

	u2 := user{
		First: "Miss",
		Last:  "Moneypenny",
		Age:   27,
		Sayings: []string{
			"James, it is soo good to see you",
			"Would you like me to take care of that for you, James?",
			"I would really prefer to be a secret agent myself.",
		},
	}

	u3 := user{
		First: "M",
		Last:  "Hmmmm",
		Age:   54,
		Sayings: []string{
			"Oh, James. You didn't.",
			"Dear God, what has James done now?",
			"Can someone please tell me where James Bond is?",
		},
	}

	users := []user{u1, u2, u3}

	fmt.Println(users)

	// your code goes here

}

```
