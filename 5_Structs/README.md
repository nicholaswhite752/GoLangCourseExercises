===========================

Ex1)

Create your own type “person” which will have an underlying type of “struct” so that it can store the following data:
● first name
● last name
● favorite ice cream flavors

Create two VALUES of TYPE person. Print out the values, ranging over the elements in the slice which stores the favorite flavors. 


===========================

Ex2)

Take the code from the previous exercise, then store the values of type person in a map with the key of last name. Access each value in the map. Print out the values, ranging over the slice.


===========================

Ex3)

● Create a new type: vehicle. 
	○ The underlying type is a struct. 
	○ The fields: 
		■ doors
		■ color 
● Create two new types: truck & sedan. 
	○ The underlying type of each of these new types is a struct. 
	○ Embed the “vehicle” type in both truck & sedan. 
	○ Give truck the field “fourWheel” which will be set to bool. 
	○ Give sedan the field “luxury” which will be set to bool. solution 
● Using the vehicle, truck, and sedan structs: 
	○ using a composite literal, create a value of type truck and assign values to the fields; 
	○ using a composite literal, create a value of type sedan and assign values to the fields. 
● Print out each of these values. 
● Print out a single field from each of these values.




===========================

Ex4)

Create and use an anonymous struct.
